# PowerShell-Fortune-Teller
This game project is the PowerShell Fortune Teller game. This game simulates a session with a virtual fortune teller who listens to player questions and then provides answers. The answers provided vary based on the fortune tellerâ€™s mood, which changes based on the time of day that questions are asked. All questions are expected to be posed in such a way that yes/no answers can be applied.
